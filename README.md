# General-Purpose-Processor

Successfully designed and implemented an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) using VHDL and Altera Quartus II. This project consists of seamless integration between various components including an registers, ALU core, control unit, finite state machine, and decoders to perform 9-bitwise operations. This output is displayed via a 7-segment display, and all functionality was verified via waveform simulations and truth tables. Below are snapshots of the block diagrams and a sample waveform simulation that was used in this project.
